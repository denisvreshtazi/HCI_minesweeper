### MINESWEEPER GAME

You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don’t.

* You can choose from 3 different levels:
    
    * *Easy* : 10 bombs in a 9x9 box
    
    * *Medium* : 40 bombs in a 16x16 box 
    
    * *Hard* : 99 bombs in a 22x22 box
    
* You start the game when a square is clickedand the icon shows the status of the game.

* If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares
(without clicking on any bombs) you win.

* Clicking a square which doesn’t have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares
containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.

* To open a square, point at the square and left click on it.

* To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click.

* If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect
bomb marking doesn’t kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.

* **To WIN** you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
